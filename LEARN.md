# Create your NEAR Testnet Wallet

In this quest, let us learn how to create our own NEAR Testnet Wallet. 
**Testnet** is a public network and the final testing network for nearcore changes before deployment to mainnet. testnet is intended for testing all aspects of the NEAR platform prior to mainnet deployment. From account creation, mock token transfers, development tooling, and smart contract development, the testnet environment closely resembles mainnet behavior. 
All nearcore changes are deployed as release candidates on first testnet, before the changes are released on mainnet. A number of testnet validators validate transactions and create new blocks. dApp developers deploy their applications on testnet before deploying on mainnet. It is important to note that testnet has its own transactions and states.

## Create your first NEAR Testnet Wallet
Here are the simple steps to create your NEAR Testnet Wallet:
1. Go to the following link and click on "Create Account":
https://wallet.testnet.near.org/

2. You can use a name that would be easy to remember to create your testnet account. Once you choose a name for your account and input in the box on this page, you will be able to get an account named **account_name**.testnet

3. In the next page, you would be required to secure your account using one of the 4 options available. "Secure Passphrase" is one of the most secure and recommended way of securing an account. We highly recommend that.

4. Post securing your account using a secure 12-word phrase, you would need to verify the secure phrase requested on the screen and viola, you now have a NEAR Testnet account which can be used to test your Dapps. Your account would automatically be populated with ~200 NEAR for testing purposes.
